/**
 * The shared, tool-neutral feedback runner (see `templates/hooks/README.md` for the
 * canonical behavior this script implements). Copied byte-for-byte into every
 * scaffolded project at `.sdd/feedback/run-feedback.mjs` (contract.md BG-11) — its
 * bytes never vary by tool. Per-tool wiring (which event maps to which mode below,
 * and how findings are returned to the agent) lives entirely in each tool's own
 * generated hook config, never here.
 *
 * This is one of two generated entry-point scripts (the other is
 * `.sdd/doctor/run-doctor.mjs`, readiness-doctor's readiness runner); both import
 * their probe evaluator from a third generated file, `.sdd/shared/probes.mjs`
 * (`templates/shared/probes.mjs`, copied byte-for-byte alongside this one) rather
 * than each carrying its own copy — the generated feedback runtime is therefore two
 * files, not one, though this script's own behavior is unchanged.
 *
 * Invocation: `node run-feedback.mjs <accumulate|run>`, run with `cwd` set to the
 * target repo root. The tool's raw hook event is piped in as JSON on STDIN.
 *
 * - `accumulate` reads a turn-key field (the first available of `turn_id`,
 *   `session_id`, `sessionId`, `conversation_id`) and `tool_input.file_path` from
 *   STDIN, appends the resolved absolute path to
 *   `.sdd/feedback/.turns/<turn-key>`, and exits 0. It never executes a mapped
 *   command (BG-3).
 * - `run` additionally takes `--commands <path-to-json-file-or-inline-json>`, a
 *   JSON array of `FeedbackCommand`-shaped objects (this script never hard-codes
 *   a command string itself — BG-7 — a generated per-tool hook config supplies
 *   this value at `harny init` time, either as a file path or as inline JSON
 *   text embedded directly in the hook's own command string). It reads the turn
 *   file for the same turn key, dedupes the
 *   accumulated paths to an absolute-path set, evaluates each command's `requires`
 *   probe (skipping with a notice, never a failure, when it resolves false — BG-9),
 *   executes the survivors exactly once (`per-file` commands receive the deduped
 *   paths appended to `argv`; `whole-project` commands do not), deletes the turn
 *   file so a reused turn key cannot leak into the next turn, and exits.
 * - `run --whole-project` (A1, CI-only) is the same `run` mode with one boolean
 *   flag set, never a third mode. It bypasses turn state entirely: no STDIN turn
 *   key is read or required, `.sdd/feedback/.turns/` is never read, written, or
 *   deleted, and every command runs unconditionally exactly once. `per-file`
 *   commands receive exactly one argument, `.` (the repo root is the whole
 *   project), in place of the turn's touched paths. The `requires` probe path is
 *   identical to normal `run` mode (BG-9). `stop_hook_active` is never read or
 *   honored under this flag — CI has no re-entry/loop-guard concept, so a finding
 *   always exits 2 (BG-19).
 *
 * Exit code convention for `run`: `0` when the turn produced no blocking-worthy
 * findings (a clean pass, a skip-only outcome, or an empty turn); `2` when a mapped
 * command's failure would otherwise warrant forcing the tool's blocking channel —
 * unless the tool's re-entry flag (`stop_hook_active`) is set on STDIN, in which
 * case no blocking response is ever emitted (BG-5), so this loop can never trip a
 * tool's own consecutive-block override. Under `--whole-project`, exit `2` is
 * never mediated by `stop_hook_active` (BG-19) — it is CI's own red/green signal.
