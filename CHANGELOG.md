## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `npx harny init` — a CLI for scaffolding the SDD pipeline into any target
  repository. Supports interactive mode (five questions: tool selection, enabled
  roles, per-role model tier, active gates, project stack) and non-interactive
  modes (`--yes` for defaults, `--config` for a saved configuration file,
  `--dry-run` to preview). Supports per-flag overrides: `--tools`, `--roles`,
  `--model`, `--gates`, `--stack`. Exit codes map to error types; writes nothing
  when any path already exists unless `--force` is given. Includes `npm run build`
  (TypeScript to `dist/`), `npm run typecheck`, and `npm test` (vitest).
- Reference generator for Claude Code, proving the `Generator` adapter interface:
  reads abstract role templates (with cost-tier and capabilities), maps tiers to
  Claude model ids (most-capable→opus, mid→sonnet, cheapest→haiku), renders
  Markdown+YAML agent frontmatter, and generates the conductor Skill. Validates
  that the interface is sufficient for all five known per-tool targets (Cursor,
  Kiro, GitHub Copilot, Codex); the other four generators are not yet shipped.
- Spec-schema deployment: the five spec-schema templates from `templates/` are
  written to `.sdd/spec-schema/` in the target repo, so the architect role's
  internal schema references resolve after generation.
- Configuration persistence: the resolved `HarnessConfig` is written to
  `.sdd/harness.json` for later use (e.g., by a future `harness mcp add` command).
- Two open reservations (non-blocking) recorded in the audit: AL-19 (a stale test
  field name in the test suite) and AL-20 (the e2e test suite validates the built
  `dist/` rather than `src/` directly, so a `src/`-only regression escapes until
  someone remembers to rebuild).
- Canonical, tool-agnostic role templates under `templates/roles/` for the full
  five-role SDD pipeline (`sdd-architect`, `sdd-test-writer`, `sdd-executor`,
  `sdd-auditor`, `sdd-documentation`), reconciled from the two prior Claude-Code-only
  copies with no `tools:` list, model id, or Claude-only path baked in as the source
  of truth — each role instead declares an abstract `cost_tier` and `capabilities`
  set.
- `templates/conductor/sdd-conductor.md` — canonical orchestration content
  describing the five-role pipeline and the three human review gates
  (post-specs, post-red-tests, post-audit), with the documentation hand-off wired
  in as a non-gated automatic step.
- `templates/spec-schema/` — the `intent`/`contract`/`roadmap`/`tasks`/`audit`
  spec templates extracted as standalone files, matching what the architect role
  emits.
- The live `sdd-documentation` agent (`.claude/agents/sdd-documentation.md`) —
  the fifth pipeline role, running automatically after a human approves the
  auditor's `APPROVED` or `APPROVED WITH RESERVATIONS` verdict. It documents only
  what the audit verified and never touches source code or code comments.
- This project's own root documentation: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  and `CLAUDE.md`.
