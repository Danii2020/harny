  Writes Architecture Decision Records for the significant decisions found in an
  approved feature's contract.md and roadmap.md, one file per decision, at
  specs/archived/<feature>/decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md with a globally monotonic number,
  and registers each one in specs/current/_index.md's ADR registry. Use this right
  after harny-sync has archived a feature (the decisions/ directory must already exist
  inside the archived feature's directory). Invoked by harny-document's post-audit
  hand-off, or directly by a human wanting to backfill decisions for an already-archived
  feature that was approved after this skill shipped.

  Requires the target feature to already be archived at specs/archived/<feature>/ (this
  skill runs after harny-sync's archive move, never before) and specs/current/_index.md
  to exist for the registry update.

# harny-adr

Writes one Architecture Decision Record per significant decision an approved feature
made, so rationale that would otherwise be stranded inside a contract's prose or an
audit log's findings becomes a durable, individually citable artifact.

## When to use this

- Invoked by `harny-document`'s post-audit hand-off, after `harny-sync` has moved the
  feature into `specs/archived/<feature>/`.
- Invocable directly by a human for any feature archived after this skill shipped.
- **Never** for the four features migrated by `sdd-skill-library` before this skill
  existed, or for any decision not traceable to an approved `contract.md`/`roadmap.md`
  — see Guardrails.

## Inputs

- The archived feature's `contract.md` and `roadmap.md` at
  `specs/archived/<feature-name>/`.
- The bundled `adr-template.md` (next to this file).
- Every existing `specs/archived/*/decisions/*.md`, to determine the next ADR number.
- `specs/current/_index.md`'s § Decisions table, to register new rows.

## Steps

1. **Scan the feature's `contract.md` and `roadmap.md`** for candidate decisions.
2. **Judge significance.** A decision earns an ADR if it meets **at least one** of:
   - (a) the contract or roadmap records a choice between two or more named viable
     options;
   - (b) it constrains future features (a rule, invariant, or reserved name others
     must obey);
   - (c) it supersedes or diverges from a previously shipped decision;
   - (d) it deliberately accepts a known cost, reservation, or unverifiable claim.
   Anything meeting none of these stays in the archived contract, where it already is
   — do not write filler ADRs.
3. **Cap at 7 ADRs per feature.** If more than seven decisions qualify, write the seven
   highest-impact and list the rest in the hand-off summary as deliberately not
   promoted.
4. **Allocate the number.** `NNNN` is a zero-padded 4-digit number, monotonic **across
   the whole repo**, not per feature. Scan `specs/archived/*/decisions/*.md` for the
   current maximum and allocate the next integer. If a number is already taken by the
   time you write (a race), rescan and allocate the next one.
5. **Write each ADR** at `specs/archived/<feature-name>/decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md`,
   following `adr-template.md` exactly: Status, Date, Feature, Capability, Source
   (the exact `contract.md § …` or `roadmap.md Phase …` citation), Trigger (which of
   (a)–(d)), Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences, Follow-ups.
6. **Register each ADR** as a new row in `specs/current/_index.md`'s § Decisions
   table (ADR number, title, status, capability, path).
7. **Report**: which decisions became ADRs, which capability each belongs to, and
   (if applicable) which candidates were not promoted and why.

## Guardrails

- **No backfill.** The four features migrated into `specs/archived/` by
  `sdd-skill-library` (`canonical-role-templates`, `cli-skeleton`,
  `cursor-kiro-copilot-generators`, `codex-generator`) get **no** ADRs — reconstructing
  rationale for shipped work retroactively risks inventing it, and their reasoning
  already exists in their archived contracts and audit logs. ADRs apply to features
  approved from `sdd-skill-library` forward.
- **Never write an ADR for a decision that fails all four significance criteria.**
- **Never exceed 7 ADRs for one feature.**
- **Never renumber or reuse an ADR number**, even for a superseded or deprecated one —
  mark its Status field instead.
- **Run only after the archive move.** The `decisions/` directory this skill writes
  into lives inside `specs/archived/<feature>/`, which does not exist until
  `harny-sync` archive mode has already run.
